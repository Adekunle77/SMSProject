# SMSProject
This app enables user to send text messages to mobile phones. To develop this app, I used Nexmoâ€™s SMS API https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/overview.

## Development
In developing the app, I used MVVM design pattern. The app makes Rest API Request, parsing JSON data with Codable. I write Unit Tests for this project. I used Core Data to save data, the enter numbers, with the date and time of when the text was sent.
